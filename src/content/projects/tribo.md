description: This project was made for manage events about different topics, we
          create, update and maintain components, pages and features for the
          managers of the events. On the other hand, we made a mobile app for
          the users of the events. I was working as a Full Stack Software
          Developer. We developed REST API in the backend to send data to the
          mobile app and for web we used graphQl. In frontend we developed
          components for react and react native for each platform.
technologies: ['Python', 'Django', 'PostgreSQL', 'JavaScript', 'Docker', 'Git', 'React.js', 'React Native', 'AWS']
